# Restaurant Reviews App

## Introduction.

This project is meant for the udacity front-end web developer nanodegree program. The main objective of this project is to re-develop an existing app. For this we have to choose an app that is not working very well and reconstruct it fully.So that now the app is responsive and accessible to users for all type of devices. The app should be able to work even though the network connection is down or poor.

## About App.
The app holds the information of a wide range of cusines. Acoording to the user's selections, respective suggestions appear.
The user can choose the best from these alternatives.
Once the user select a specific restaurant, he/she recieves the basic informations regarding the restaurant such as address, cusine, opening and closing, other users reviews and rating.  




3. Project needs a local server to run. 
	1. Open a bash command line window in the repository folder. 
	2. Check if python is installed in your computer by typing `python -V` or `py -V`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
	3. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `py -m http.server 8000` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`.

4. When you have a server up and running, open your browser and
visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
